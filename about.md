# About

This website was created in order to help with NIST's post-quantum standardisation process. A centralised website for these implementation results means they are much easier to find, and one can also discover what research has already been undertaken and what hasn't.

# How to add your own results

1. Head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pqczoo/pqczoo.github.io/) of the website.
2. Find the data file of what table you wish to update:
  - The SCA table is found at [/_data/sca.yml](https://github.com/pqczoo/pqczoo.github.io/blob/master/_data/sca.yml).
  - The hardware table is found at [/_data/hardware.yml](https://github.com/pqczoo/pqczoo.github.io/blob/master/_data/hardware.yml). 
  - The microcontrollers table is found at [/_data/microcontrollers.yml](https://github.com/pqczoo/pqczoo.github.io/blob/master/_data/hardware.yml).
3. Edit the file and add a new entry following the structure:
- Hardware and microcontroller entries look like this:

```
- Authors: James Howe, Tobias Oder, Markus Krausz, Tim GÃ¼neysu
  PQC Type: Lattice-Based
  Crypto Type: KEM
  Crypto Target: Frodo
  Device: Artix-7 FPGA
  Date: 17 July 2018
  Reference: eprint.iacr.org/2018/686
  Conference: CHES 2018
```

- SCA results looks like this:

```
- Authors: Martin R. Albrecht and Amit Deo and Kenneth G. Paterson
  PQC Type: Lattice-Based
  Crypto Type: KEM
  Crypto Target: Kyber, NewHope
  Attack Type: Cold boot attack
  Date: 12 July 2018
  Reference: eprint/2018/672
  Conference: CHES 2018
```

4. Submit this change and then create a pull request. Once this has been approved the table will automatically update.
